# 26 the build workflow

we want to set up react locally, in our machine

- recommended for SPAs and MPAs

# why?

we want to optimize our Code

we want to ship code as small as possible

that increases the performance our app

use next-gen javascript features

for developers, life is easier. code is easier

in code pen we switched babel

we want to write ES6 and ES7 that work in old browsers.
- be more productive: css auto prefixing
linting

# how do we achieve

we need dependency management tool

react and reactdom is a dependency

all the tools are dependencys

we use NPM, node package manager


use dependency management tool npm or yarn

use bundler recommended: webpack

webpack does not only bundle files, it also compiles es6 es7
we'll use babel + presets, can be hook with webpack, so its part of the bundling process

use a development server

there is a tool created by the react team
