# 31 jsx restrictions

jsx enables us to write html

since we are in js world, certain words are already taken by js

like class, thats why we use className

another restriction is

we can not return adyjacent elements

```html
<div className="App">
  <h1>Hi i am whatever</h1>
  <h2>second</h2>
</div>
```

without the wrapper, does not work
